summary: Solutions to all 25 days in the Julia programming language.
---

It is Christmas night, and it is the first time this month that I haven't had to plan my schedule for the evening around a programming puzzle contest.
For the last 25 days this month, I participated in [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/), and I managed to collect all 50 stars!

![](images/advent-of-code-2020-stars.png)

I solved all the puzzles in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language, and my solutions are available [here](https://github.com/kdheepak/adventofcode/tree/master/2020/julia/src).

In this post, I wanted to share why I think you should do Advent of Code and idiomatic solutions to all 25 days in the Julia programming language.

# Why Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a lot of fun.
I think there's a few reasons I find it quite enjoyable.

Firstly, there's the competitive aspect of it.

A single puzzle unlocks every night at midnight Eastern Time, and the time when you submit a solution is recorded.
There's a global leaderboard that highlights the top 100 fastest times but you also have the ability to make a private leaderboard that you can share with anyone you like, and you can use that to track your time and challenge your friends or peers.

For straightforward puzzles, it is a lot of fun to see who can read, grok and type out a bug-free working program the fastest.
A bunch of people also upload recordings of their attempts, and it is humbling to see how fast they can whip out a correct solution to a problem.

Secondly, unlike most other competitive programming challenges, the puzzles are mainly designed to be a teaching / learning experience.

Every puzzle has two parts, where the first part introduces a prompt, and requires you to solve it before viewing the second part.
The first part tends to set up an idea or check that you are on the right track, and the second part tends to extend the idea or subvert an obvious decision you made in the first part.

Almost all the problems require parsing text input of various formats.
In some of the latter puzzles, the puzzle inputs may be designed to hedge against certain naive solutions.
Some puzzle inputs will only work with certain data structures or certain algorithms.
There are a lot of "ah ha" moments when you figure what you should use and when, which makes for a very satisfying solve.

Most problems are based on standard computer science programming concepts, but are never presented as such.
Some problems have a mathematics tilt to it, which can make finding those solutions quite rewarding.
But also, every problem is designed such that even if you don't know the "theory" behind it you'll be able to stumble your way into solving it if you persevere.
Reading other people's one liners after you hacked it together is quite enlightening.

And since various programming language communities discuss their solutions in dedicated forums, there tends to be a lot of discussion about the tips and tricks you can use in your favourite programming language to express the problem more elegantly.
Even after having used Python and Julia for years now, I still learn new things when I read other people's solutions.

And finally, that brings me to the community.

The [/r/adventofcode](https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode) subreddit and the Julia [Zulip](https://julialang.zulipchat.com) and [Slack](https://julialang.slack.com/) channel have been a joy to visit every day after solving the puzzles.
I've particularly enjoyed seeing all the neat visualizations that come out of Advent of Code by the community.

That's the really neat thing about Advent of Code.
The problems are short enough to be solved in less than an hour, the solutions are small enough to be written in just one file, puzzles tend to tackle just one concept or idea, and there is a large enough community around it.
Consequently, a lot of people tend to share their solutions, and you get to see a lot of discussion around each puzzle, including a number of different ways to approach the same problem.

If you've never heard of Advent of Code, I highly recommend you try it out.
Below I'll be discussing solutions in Julia that were shared on [Zulip](https://julialang.zulipchat.com), [Slack](https://julialang.slack.com/) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode).
This will contain spoilers for all days in Advent of Code 2020.

## [Day 1: Report Repair](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)

Day 1 of advent of code is basically intended to check that you have a programming language installed, and you know how to use simple features it in (e.g. `for` loops).

You can solve the first day with just multiple `for` loops.
However, a more idiomatic solution can be expressed using the `combinations` function from the [Combinatorics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Combinatorics.jl)[^python]:

[^python]: _aside_: Python has a similar function in the standard library: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations>

```julia
using Combinatorics

readInput() = sort(parse.(Int, split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)))))

expense_report(data, n) = only(prod(items) for items in combinations(data, n) if sum(items) == 2020)

part1(data = readInput()) = expense_report(data, 2)
part2(data = readInput()) = expense_report(data, 3)
```

In Julia, small functions are usually made into their single line form.
Here's how you would write it if you would like to do it in the multi-line form.

```julia
function part1(data = readInput())
    expense_report(data, 2)
end
```

Functions also implicitly return the last expression evaluated as part of the function body, if an explicit `return` is not present.

## [Day 2: Password Philosophy](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)

Day 2 is a simple case of parsing, counting characters in a string and knowing that "exactly one" can be expressed using the `xor` operation.

The solution below is based on [Sukera's](https://github.com/Seelengrab/AdventOfCode).

```julia
readInput() = split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n')

function parseInput(data)
    d = split.(data, ": ")
    map(d) do (policy,password)
        rule, letter = split(policy, ' ')
        low, high = parse.(Int, split(rule, '-'))
        (low, high, only(letter), strip(password))
    end
end

function part1(data = readInput())
    count(parseInput(data)) do (low, high, letter, password)
        low <= count(==(letter), password) <= high
    end
end

function part2(data = readInput())
    count(parseInput(data)) do (low, high, letter, password)
        (password[low] == letter) ⊻ (password[high] == letter)
    end
end
```

Julia supports an infix operator for `xor`: `⊻`.

If a function `f` takes another function as the first argument, you can use the `f(c) do ... end` block syntax to map over every element in the collection `c` and apply the anonymous function defined by the `do ... end` block, the result of which is processed by the function `f`.

For example, if you would like to do the following:

```julia
julia> is_a(letter) = letter == "a"

julia> count(is_a, ["a", "b", "c"])
1
```

you can express it like so instead:

```julia
julia> count(["a", "b", "c"]) do letter
    letter == "a"
end
1
```

Alternatively, you can pass in an anonymous function as the first argument by using the thin arrow `->`:

```julia
julia> count(letter -> letter == "a", ["a", "b", "c"])
1
```

In Julia, you can use the `only` function to get the one and only element in a collection.

```julia
julia> only("h")
'h': ASCII/Unicode U+0068 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

## [Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)

A lot of advent of code problems have the puzzle input as text that represents a grid.
Day 3 is our first introduction to a grid of trees.

Having a one liner to convert the text input to a `Matrix` can be very useful.

```julia
readInput() = permutedims(reduce(hcat, collect.(readlines(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt")))))
```

Here's what the input for this particular day looks like:

```julia
julia> A = readInput();

julia> typeof(A)
Matrix{Char} (alias for Array{Char, 2})

julia> size(A)
(323, 31)

julia> xy = findall(==('#'), A);

julia> using SparseArrays; sparse([p.I[1] for p in xy], [p.I[2] for p in xy], [1 for _ in xy])
323×31 SparseMatrixCSC{Int64, Int64} with 2611 stored entries:

```

This solution is based on [Henrique Ferrolho's](https://github.com/ferrolho/advent-of-code/blob/b34dbe9ee5eef7a36fbf77044c83acc75fbe54cf/2020/03/puzzle.jl) solution.

```julia
function solve(trees, slope)
    n = cld(size(trees, 1), slope.y)
    rs = range(1, step=slope.y, length=n)
    cs = range(1, step=slope.x, length=n)
    cs = map(c -> mod1(c, size(trees, 2)), cs)
    idxs = CartesianIndex.(rs, cs)
    count(==('#'), trees[idxs])
end

part1(data = readInput()) = solve(data, (x = 3, y = 1))
part2(data = readInput()) = prod(solve.(Ref(data), [(x=1,y=1),(x=5,y=1),(x=3,y=1),(x=7,y=1),(x=1,y=2)]))
```

In Julia, you `==(e)` returns a "fixed" function which partially applies over the value of `e` and accepts one argument which you can use to test equality.

```julia
julia> ==('#')('#')
true

julia> ==('#')('.')
false
```

Julia has `mod1` for 1 based mod, which is useful for indexing in these type of situations.
Julia also has ceiling division (`cld`) and floor division (`fld`) which happen to be handy here.

Julia has support for broadcasting using the `f.(c)` syntax,
which allows for the element by element application of the method `f` on every element in the collection `c`, i.e. `f(e) for e in c`.
This tends to be very handy in Advent of Code.

```julia
julia> c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

julia> f(x::Int) = x + 1;

julia> println(f.(c))
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Additionally, you can use `Ref(data)` to tell Julia that it is a singleton that shouldn't be broadcast over.
Alternatively, you can use `(data,)` to get the same behavior.

## [Day 4: Passport Processing](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)

Since the input has passports separated by an empty line, you can split on `"\n\n"` to get each passport into an element of a `Vector`.

```julia
readInput() = split(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String), "\n\n")
```

This is what the first 5 passports look like:

```julia
julia> readInput() |> x -> first(x, 3)
5-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "hgt:159cm\npid:561068005 eyr:2025 iyr:2017 cid:139 ecl:blu hcl:#ceb3a1\nbyr:1940"
 "iyr:2014\nbyr:1986 pid:960679613 eyr:2025 ecl:hzl"
 "cid:211 ecl:blu hcl:#7d3b0c iyr:2011 pid:006632702\nbyr:1982 eyr:2023 hgt:68in"
```

Julia allows piping the results of one function into another using `|>`.

Learning how to use regex well in your programming language of choice can make solutions concise and terse.
Check out this solution by [Pablo Zubieta](https://github.com/pabloferz/AoC/blob/e64841e31d9dc9391be73b041a2e01795dafa1b6/2020/04/Day4.jl):

```julia
const fields1 = (r"byr", r"iyr", r"eyr", r"hgt", r"hcl", r"ecl", r"pid")
const fields2 = (
    r"byr:(19[2-9][0-9]|200[0-2])\b",
    r"iyr:20(1[0-9]|20)\b",
    r"eyr:20(2[0-9]|30)\b",
    r"hgt:(1([5-8][0-9]|9[0-3])cm|(59|6[0-9]|7[0-6])in)\b",
    r"hcl:#[0-9a-f]{6}\b",
    r"ecl:(amb|blu|brn|gry|grn|hzl|oth)\b",
    r"pid:\d{9}\b"
)

part1(data = readInput()) = count(p -> all(t -> contains(p, t), fields1), data)
part2(data = readInput()) = count(p -> all(t -> contains(p, t), fields2), data)
```

There were a lot of puzzles this year where I would have been able to parse the input more easily by knowing just a little bit more regex.

## [Day 5: Binary Boarding](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5)

Sometimes having a little insight into what the problem is asking can go a long way.
For example, in this puzzle, the seat ID is just a binary representation of the input.

```render_svgbob
FBFBBFFRLR

    |
    v

0101100101

    |
    v

   357
```

So you can calculate the seat ID using binary shifting or by converting the input to `1`s and `0`s and parsing the input as a binary number directly.

This solution is based on [Andrey Oskin's](https://github.com/Arkoniak/advent_of_code/blob/c692bc20147362cfb373e1483cf73588489a597b/2020/05/day05.jl):

```julia
seatid(s) = reduce((x, y) -> (x << 1) | ((y == 'R') | (y == 'B')), s; init = 0)
# OR
seatid(s) = parse(Int, map(c -> c ∈ ('R', 'B') ? '1' : '0', s), base = 2)

part1() = mapreduce(seatid, max, eachline(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt")))

function part2()
    seats = sort(seatid.(eachline(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"))))
    prev = first(seats)
    for seat in seats
        (seat - prev == 2) && return prev + 1
        prev = seat
    end
end
```

The `eachline` function is an alternative to `readlines`.
It iteratively reads from a stream or IO.

## [Day 6: Custom Customs](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6)

Day 6 introduces set operations with the prompt asking you to identify "any" and "every" question, which can be expressed using `union` and `intersect`.

```julia
readInput() = split.(split(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String), "\n\n"))

part1(data = readInput()) = sum(q -> length(∪(Set.(q)...)), data)
part2(data = readInput()) = sum(q -> length(∩(Set.(q)...)), data)
```

In Julia, you can use the unicode symbols of mathematical operations for `union` and `intersect` of sets, namely `∪` and `∩` respectively.
In the Julia REPL or text editors with Julia plugins, you can use the \LaTeX name and tab complete to get the unicode symbol.

```julia
julia> \cup<TAB>

julia> ∪
union (generic function with 5 methods)

julia> \cap<TAB>

julia> ∩
intersect (generic function with 19 methods)
```

Also, julia has methods on functions like `sum` that accept a function as the first argument, which is useful for mapping over every element in a collection.

The `...` operator can be used to splat elements from a collection into arguments of a function.

```julia
julia> f(a, b, c) = @show a, b, c;

julia> x = [1, 2, 3];

julia> f(x...);
(a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)
```

## [Day 7: Handy Haversacks](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)

Day 7 is the first introduction to graphs this year.
While it is possible to find solutions to both parts of this puzzle using recursion,
the problem can be well represented as a graph.

This code is based on [Ali Hamed Moosavian's](https://github.com/CNOT) and [Andrey Oskin's](https://github.com/Arkoniak/advent_of_code/blob/c692bc20147362cfb373e1483cf73588489a597b/2020/07/day07.jl) solutions and visualizations:

```julia
using LightGraphs
using SimpleWeightedGraphs

readInput() = build_graph(split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n'))

function build_graph(data)
    edges = []
    for line in data
        outer_bag, inner_bags = split(line, " contain ")
        occursin("no other bags", inner_bags) && continue
        for bag in split(inner_bags, ", ")
            counter, name = parse(Int, first(bag)), strip(bag[3:end], '.')
            e = String(rstrip(outer_bag, 's')), String(rstrip(name, 's')), counter
            push!(edges, e)
        end
    end

    nodes = collect(Set(src for (src, _, _) in edges) ∪ Set(dst for (_, dst, _) in edges))
    mapping = Dict(n => i for (i,n) in enumerate(nodes))

    g = SimpleWeightedDiGraph(length(nodes))
    for (src, dst, counter) in edges
        add_edge!(g, mapping[src], mapping[dst], counter)
    end
    g, mapping, nodes
end
```

Now that you have built a graph, you can find the solution by just traversing the graph.

```julia
part1(data = readInput()) = part1(data[1], data[2])
part1(g, mapping) = count(!=(0), bfs_parents(g, mapping["shiny gold bag"], dir = :in)) - 1

function total_bags(g, v)
    isempty(neighbors(g, v)) && return 1
    1 + sum(neighbors(g, v)) do nb
        Int(g.weights[nb, v]) * total_bags(g, nb)
    end
end

part2(data = readInput()) = part2(data[1], data[2])
part2(g, mapping) = total_bags(g, mapping["shiny gold bag"]) - 1
```

![part1](images/adventofcode-day07-part1.png){ width=45% } ![part2](images/adventofcode-day07-part2.png){ width=45% }

Julia allows for [multiple dispatch](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/) based on the number of arguments and the type of each argument.
This lets you define multiple methods of a function.

## [Day 8: Handheld Halting](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8)

Day 8 appears to be a straightforward op code interpreter.

```julia
readInput() = strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String))

part1(data = readInput()) = boot(split(data, '\n'))
part2(data = readInput()) = corrupt(split(data, '\n'))

function boot(instructions)
    acc, i, s = 0, 1, Set{Int}()
    while true
        i ∈ s ? break : push!(s, i)
        inst, n = split(instructions[i])
        n = parse(Int, n)
        inst == "acc" && ( i += 1; acc += n )
        inst == "jmp" && ( i += n )
        inst == "nop" && ( i += 1 )
    end
    acc
end

function corrupt(original_instructions)
    for j in 1:length(original_instructions)
        boot_loop_detected = false
        acc, i, s = 0, 1, Set{Int}()
        instructions = copy(original_instructions)
        if occursin("jmp", instructions[j])
            instructions[j] = replace(instructions[j], "jmp" => "nop")
        elseif occursin("nop", instructions[j])
            instructions[j] = replace(instructions[j], "nop" => "jmp")
        end
        while true
            i ∈ s ? ( boot_loop_detected = true; break ) : push!(s, i)
            i > length(instructions) && break
            inst, n = split(instructions[i])
            n = parse(Int, n)
            inst == "acc" && ( i += 1; acc += n )
            inst == "jmp" && ( i += n )
            inst == "nop" && ( i += 1 )
        end
        !boot_loop_detected && return acc
    end
end
```

I believe this problem can also be represented as a graph and solved using memoized depth first search.
I would like to re-write this solution using [`LightGraphs.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl).

## [Day 9: Encoding Error](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9)

Day 9 was also straightforward.

```julia
readInput() = parse.(Int, split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n'))

function check(numbers, n)
    for i in numbers, j in numbers
        i + j == n && return true
    end
    false
end

function part1(numbers = readInput())
    preamble = 25
    for i in (preamble + 1):length(numbers)
        check(numbers[i-preamble:i-1], numbers[i]) && continue
        return i, numbers[i]
    end
end

function part2(numbers = readInput())
    idx, num = part1(numbers)
    for i in eachindex(numbers), j in i:lastindex(numbers)
        sum(numbers[i:j]) == num && return sum(extrema(numbers[i:j]))
    end
end
```

Julia has a function called `extrema` that computes the minimum and maximum element in a single pass.

```julia
julia> extrema([1,2,3,4,5])
(1, 5)
```

[Teo ShaoWei](https://github.com/Teo-ShaoWei)'s solution using [Combinatorics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Combinatorics.jl) is also quite elegant.

```julia
using Combinatorics

readInput() = parse.(Int, split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n'))

function bad_number(nums, k)
    for i in (k + 1):length(nums)
        if !any(num1 + num2 == nums[i] for (num1, num2) in combinations(nums[i-k:i-1], 2))
            return (i, nums[i])
        end
    end
end

function rectify(nums, k)
    v = bad_number(nums, k)
    i = j = 1
    while (s = sum(nums[i:j])) != v
        s < v ? j += 1 : i += 1
    end
    return minimum(nums[i:j]) + maximum(nums[i:j])
end

input = readInput()
part1 = bad_number(input, 25)
part2 = rectify(input, 25)
```

## [Day 10: Adapter Array](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10)

Part 2 on this day asks to find the number of distinct ways to arrange the Jolt adapters to connect the charging outlet to the device.

This problem can be formulated as a dynamic programming problem.
This is most straightforward to solve using recursion and memoization.
Here's [Tom Kwong's](https://github.com/tk3369/AdventOfCode2020/blob/1273e4a086832c5c159fe460f533016fedb33ab2/day10.jl) solution:

```julia
function readInput()
    data = parse.(Int, split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n')) |> sort
    vcat(0, data, data[end]+3)
end

part1(data = readInput()) = count(==(1), diff(data)) * count(==(3), diff(data))

function part2(data = readInput())
    len = length(data)
    dct = Dict{Int,Int}()
    function helper(v, i)
        haskey(dct, i) && return dct[i]
        i == len && return 1
        n1 =               v[i+1] - v[i] <= 3 ? helper(v, i+1) : 0
        n2 = i+2 <= len && v[i+2] - v[i] <= 3 ? helper(v, i+2) : 0
        n3 = i+3 <= len && v[i+3] - v[i] <= 3 ? helper(v, i+3) : 0
        val = n1 + n2 + n3
        dct[i] = val
        return val
    end
    helper(data, 1)
end
```

One key insight here is that the data doesn't contain jolt adapters that are only 1 or 3 apart.

```julia
julia> StatsBase.countmap(diff(readInput()))
Dict{Int64, Int64} with 2 entries:
  3 => 32
  1 => 71
```

Since any adapter that is 3 away can't be removed, the number of distinct ways is just the product of all the different ways you can choose two adapters from the set of 1 away adapters that are in between the 3 away adapters.
Here's a solution based on [Jonnie Diegelman's](https://github.com/jonniedie/Advent2020/blob/dd722991120aa79cf4e0ec028612fb0c48d7d54c/scripts/Day10/code.jl) that takes advantage of that:

```julia
function readInput()
    data = parse.(Int, split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n')) |> sort
    data = vcat(0, data, data[end]+3)
    join(string.(diff(data)))
end

part1(data = readInput()) = count(==('1'), data) * count(==('3'), data)
part2(data = readInput()) = prod(binomial.(length.(split(data, '3', keepempty=false)), 2) .+ 1)
```

This only works however when the set of 1 away adapters is not longer than 5 elements, which is the case in our puzzle inputs.

Alternatively, because the steps needed are one, two or three, you can calculate all possible steps by using a tribonacci sum.
The tribonacci sum gives us all ways to traverse a set of ones, i.e. `11111...` by hopping from `1` to `1` in steps of size 1, 2 or 3.

Thanks to [Sukera](https://github.com/Seelengrab/AdventOfCode) and [Andrey Oskin](https://github.com/Arkoniak/advent_of_code/blob/master/2020/10/day10.jl) for their code and insight into solving this puzzle.

```julia
function readInput()
    data = parse.(Int, split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n')) |> sort
    data = vcat(0, data, data[end]+3)
    split(join(string.(diff(data))), '3', keepempty = false)
end

function tribonacci(n)
    n <= 1 && return 1
    n == 2 && return 2
    tribonacci(n-1) + tribonacci(n-2) + tribonacci(n-3)
end

part2(data = readInput()) = prod(tribonacci.(length.(data)))
```

The tribonacci sequence can also be generalized:

```julia
const a1 = (19 + 3sqrt(33))^(1/3)
const a2 = (19 - 3sqrt(33))^(1/3)
const b = (586 + 102sqrt(33))^(1/3)
tribonacci(n) = round(Int, (3b * (1/3 * (a1 + a2 + 1))^(n + 1))/(b^2 - 2b + 4))
```

See the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers#Tribonacci_numbers) article for more information.

## [Day 11: Seating System](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11)

This is the first tribute in Advent of Code 2020 to [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), who passed away earlier this year.
John Conway was an English mathematician, most notably famous for the invention of the cellular automation called the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

```julia
readInput() = permutedims(reduce(hcat, collect.(split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n'))))

part1(data = readInput()) = simulate(data, 0, 1)
part2(data = readInput()) = simulate(data, 1, size(data, 1) * 2)

function simulate(grid, company, sight)
    while true
        old_grid = deepcopy(grid)
        tick(grid, company, sight)
        grid == old_grid && break
    end
    count(==('#'), grid)
end

function tick(grid, company, sight)
    rows, cols = size(grid)
    old_grid = deepcopy(grid)
    for r in 1:rows, c in 1:cols
        A = adjacent_seats(old_grid, r, c, sight)
        grid[r, c] == 'L' && count(==('#'), A) == 0 && ( grid[r, c] = '#' )
        grid[r, c] == '#' && count(==('#'), A) >= 4 + company && ( grid[r, c] = 'L' )
    end
end

function adjacent_seats(grid, i, j, sight)
    A = []
    for direction in CartesianIndex.([(-1,-1), (-1,+1), (+1,-1), (+1, +1), (-1,0), (+1,0), (0,-1), (0,+1)])
        xy = CartesianIndex(i, j) + direction
        counter = 1
        while checkbounds(Bool, grid, xy) && grid[xy] == '.' && counter < sight
            xy += direction
            counter += 1
        end
        checkbounds(Bool, grid, xy) && push!(A, grid[xy])
    end
    A
end
```

The key thing to remember when implementing cellular automata is to copy the grid at each tick.

Julia's `CartesianIndex` makes it easier to deal with multi-dimensional indexing.
Additionally, I found the `checkbounds` function quite handy for this problem.

## [Day 12: Rain Risk](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12)

This was one of my better performances on the Julia leaderboard.
Using complex numbers makes it quite straightforward to deal with problems involving rotation.

```julia
readInput() = split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n')

function part1(data = readInput())
    data = map(data) do d
        first(d), parse(Int, d[begin+1:end])
    end
    current = 0 + 0im
    direction = 1 + 0im
    for (action, move) in data
        if     action == 'N' current += move * im
        elseif action == 'S' current -= move * im
        elseif action == 'E' current += move
        elseif action == 'W' current -= move
        elseif action == 'F' current += direction * move
        elseif action == 'L' direction *= im^(move ÷ 90)
        elseif action == 'R' direction *= (-im)^(move ÷ 90)
        else   error("Unrecognized $action, $move") end
    end
    abs(current.re) + abs(current.im)
end

function part2(data = readInput())
    data = map(data) do d
        first(d), parse(Int, d[begin+1:end])
    end
    waypoint = 10 + 1im
    current = 0 + 0im
    direction = 1 + 0im
    for (action, move) in data
        if     action == 'N' waypoint += move * im
        elseif action == 'S' waypoint -= move * im
        elseif action == 'E' waypoint += move
        elseif action == 'W' waypoint -= move
        elseif action == 'F' current += waypoint * move
        elseif action == 'L' waypoint *= im^(move ÷ 90)
        elseif action == 'R' waypoint *= (-im)^(move ÷ 90)
        else   error("Unrecognized $action, $move") end
    end
    abs(current.re) + abs(current.im)
end
```

## [Day 13: Shuttle Search](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/13)

This was one of the harder days for me.
I had never heard of [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) (CRT) and apparently that's what this problem was based on.

Here's a solution by [Micah Halter](https://git.mehalter.com/mehalter/AOC.jl/src/commit/e65eccac7e3825d5d9706b18e1fe244958f5f1e8/2020/src/day_13.jl) that uses the `CRT` function from [Mods.jl](https://github.com/scheinerman/Mods.jl) package.

```julia
using Mods

function readInput()
    t_str, buses_str = readlines(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"))
    time = parse(Int, t_str)
    buses = map(x->x=="x" ? nothing : parse(Int, x), split(buses_str, ','))
    time, buses
end

function part1(data = readInput())
    time, buses = data
    wait, bus = min(map(x->(x*ceil(time / x), x), filter(!isnothing, buses))...)
    (wait - time) * bus
end

function part2(data = readInput())
    _, buses = data
    mods = map(k->Mod{buses[k]}(-(k-1)), filter(k->!isnothing(buses[k]), keys(buses)))
    CRT(mods...).val
end
```

Here's another solution from [Doug](https://github.com/dgkf/advent-of-code/blob/98ee142a61b453a766331c65ece372978041935e/2020/13/13.jl) that finds the cycles using `lcm` much more elegantly than how I ended up doing it.
The key bit of insight here is that the `lcm(previous_bus_schedules, new_bus_schedule)` will be the cycle at which the pattern repeats.
Using this, you can break the problem down by iteratively and calculate the next cycle.

```julia
function readInput()
    input = readlines(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"))
    n = parse(Int, input[1])
    schedule = parse.(Int, replace(split(input[2], ","), "x" => "-1"))
    bus_n = filter(!=(-1), schedule)
    bus_dt = (1:length(schedule))[schedule .!= -1] .- 1
    bus_n, bus_dt, n
end

function part1(data = readInput())
    bus_n, bus_dt, n = data
    min_rem, min_rem_i = findmin(bus_n .- n .% bus_n)
    bus_n[min_rem_i] * min_rem
end

function part2(data = readInput())
    bus_n, bus_dt, n = data
    inc = bus_n[1]
    n = 0
    for (i, offset) in zip(bus_n[2:end], bus_dt[2:end])
        while (n + offset) % i != 0
            n += inc
        end
        inc = lcm(inc, i)
    end
    return n
end
```

## [Day 14: Docking Data](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/14)

This puzzle requires dealing with bit shifting and masking of bits.

Here's [Pablo Zubieta's](https://github.com/pabloferz/AoC/) solution:

```julia
function parse_mask_ops(line)
    mask, list = split(line, r"\n"; limit = 2, keepempty = false)
    instructions = Tuple{Int,Int}[]
    for m in eachmatch(r"mem.(\d+). = (\d+)", list)
        address, n = m.captures
        push!(instructions, (parse(Int, address), parse(Int, n)))
    end
    return mask, instructions
end

readInput() = parse_mask_ops.(split(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String), r"mask = "; keepempty = false))

struct Part1 end
struct Part2 end

function write!(::Part1, memory, mask, addr, n)
    for (i, bit) in enumerate(mask)
        if bit != 'X'
            m = 1 << (36 - i)
            n = (bit == '1') ? (n | m) : (n & ~m)
        end
    end
    memory[addr] = n
end

function write!(::Part2, memory, mask, addr, n)
    inds = Int8[]
    for (i, bit) in enumerate(mask)
        if bit == '1'
            addr |= (1 << (36 - i))
        elseif bit == 'X'
            push!(inds, i)
        end
    end
    l = length(inds)
    for p in 0:(2^l - 1)
        for (k, i) in enumerate(inds)
            m = 1 << (36 - i)
            b = (p >> (l - k)) & 1
            addr = b != 0 ? (addr | m) : (addr & ~m)
        end
        memory[addr] = n
    end
end

function solve(p::Union{Part1,Part2}, input)
    memory = Dict{Int,Int}()
    for (mask, list) in input
        for (address, n) in list
            write!(p, memory, mask, address, n)
        end
    end
    return sum(values(memory))
end

part1(data = readInput()) = solve(Part1(), data)
part2(data = readInput()) = solve(Part2(), data)
```

I liked this solution because it was clean _and_ fast:

```julia
julia> @btime part1();
  392.104 μs (2987 allocations: 251.47 KiB)

julia> @btime part2();
  5.218 ms (4426 allocations: 5.96 MiB)
```

For comparison, these were the times from my original solution:

```julia
julia> @btime part1();
  2.860 ms (75635 allocations: 4.77 MiB)

julia> @btime part2();
  287.836 ms (6234948 allocations: 319.65 MiB)
```

There are more optimized solutions though, for example here are the timings for [the solution posted by Colin Caine](https://github.com/cmcaine/advent2020/blob/aae90d873af5a7ce870a1e0bb0355b598ee389fe/src/day14.jl):

```julia
julia> @btime part1();
  25.614 μs (14 allocations: 23.98 KiB)

julia> @btime part2();
  3.354 ms (41 allocations: 5.67 MiB)

julia> @btime part2a();
  2.865 ms (37 allocations: 5.67 MiB)
```

## [Day 15: Rambunctious Recitation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/15)

This puzzle seemed to mainly focus on choosing the right data structure for the `history` of the memory game.
Storing it as a mapping of number to list of indices works well for both parts.
A mapping of indices to number will cause the code to be slow, and will make solving part 2 impractical.

Here's a solution by [Sukera](https://github.com/Seelengrab/):

```julia
readInput() = parse.(Int, split(readline(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt")), ','))

makeArr() = Int[]

function solve(input, goal=2020)
    history = Dict{Int, Vector{Int}}()
    for (idx, num) in enumerate(input)
        history[num] = [idx]
    end
    turn = length(input) + 1
    num = 0
    for t in turn:goal-1
        arr = get!(history, num, makeArr())
        push!(arr, t)
        if isone(length(arr))
            num = 0
        else
            num = abs(arr[end-1] - arr[end])
        end
    end
    num
end

part1(data = readInput()) = solve(data)
part2(data = readInput()) = solve(data, 30000000)
```

## [Day 16: Ticket Translation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16)

Calculating which fields were invalid for part 1 was rather straightforward.

```julia
function readInput()
    data = strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String))
    rules, your_ticket, nearby_tickets = split(data, "\n\n")
    rules = Dict(map(split(rules, '\n')) do rule
        rule, r1start, r1end, r2start, r2end = match(r"([\w ]+): (\d+)-(\d+) or (\d+)-(\d+)", rule)
        r1start, r1end, r2start, r2end = parse.(Int, [r1start, r1end, r2start, r2end])
        rule => (r1start:r1end, r2start:r2end)
    end)
    your_ticket = parse.(Int, split(split(your_ticket, '\n')[2], ','))
    nearby_tickets = [parse.(Int, ticket) for ticket in split.(split(nearby_tickets, '\n')[2:end], ',')]
    rules, your_ticket, nearby_tickets
end

function part1(data = readInput())
    rules, your_ticket, nearby_tickets = data
    invalid_fields = Int[]
    for ticket in nearby_tickets, field in ticket
        !any([field ∈ rule for rule in Iterators.flatten(values(rules))]) && push!(invalid_fields, field)
    end
    sum(invalid_fields)
end
```

I believe part 2 is better expressed as a graph where you solve the max flow problem to find the maximum matching.
However, this is not how I solved it below.
I'm hoping to re-solve this problem using [LightGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl).

```julia
function part2(data = readInput())
    rules, your_ticket, nearby_tickets = data

    invalid_tickets = Int[]
    for (i, ticket) in enumerate(nearby_tickets), field in ticket
        !any([field ∈ rule for rule in Iterators.flatten(values(rules))]) && push!(invalid_tickets, i)
    end
    valid_tickets = deleteat!(nearby_tickets, invalid_tickets)

    valid = ones(Bool, length(first(valid_tickets)), length(rules))
    for ticket in valid_tickets, (i, field) in enumerate(ticket), (j, rule) in enumerate(rules)
        _, (rule1, rule2) = rule
        !(field ∈ rule1 || field ∈ rule2) && ( valid[i, j] = false )
    end

    final = [0 for _ in 1:length(rules)]
    accounted_for = Set{Int}()
    while length(accounted_for) != length(rules)
        for i in 1:length(first(valid_tickets))
            valid_rules = [j for j in 1:length(rules) if valid[i, j] && j ∉ accounted_for]
            if length(valid_rules) == 1
                final[i] = only(valid_rules)
                push!(accounted_for, only(valid_rules))
            end
        end
    end

    answer = 1
    for (interest, k) in enumerate(keys(rules))
        !startswith(k, "departure") && continue
        for (i, index) in enumerate(final)
            index == interest && ( answer *= your_ticket[i] )
        end
    end
    answer
end
```

My learning from this day was that in Julia you can refactor the code with multiple nested `for` loops:

```julia
for ticket in valid_tickets
    for (i, field) in enumerate(ticket)
        for (j, rule) in enumerate(rules)
            _, (rule1, rule2) = rule
            !(field ∈ rule1 || field ∈ rule2) && ( valid[i, j] = false )
        end
    end
end
```

into a single line like so:

```julia
for ticket in valid_tickets, (i, field) in enumerate(ticket), (j, rule) in enumerate(rules)
    _, (rule1, rule2) = rule
    !(field ∈ rule1 || field ∈ rule2) && ( valid[i, j] = false )
end
```

You can even use the variable from the outer loop as the index in the inner loop, like you'd expect.
This can help reduce the nesting level of your inner expressions.

## [Day 17: Conway Cubes](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17)

Another homage to [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), this time in multiple dimensions.

Here's [Michael Krabbe Borregaard's](https://github.com/mkborregaard) succinct solution that takes advantage of `CartesianIndices`:

```julia
function parsefield(lines, n, dims)
    field = falses(fill(n, dims)...)
    for (i,line) in enumerate(lines), (j, char) in enumerate(line)
        char == '#' && (field[i + n÷2, j + n÷2, fill(n÷2, dims-2)...] = true)
    end
    field
end

function startup(lines, rounds, dims)
    field = parsefield(lines, 2*(length(lines) + rounds + 2), dims)
    newfield = copy(field)
    for n in 1:rounds
        for ind in CartesianIndices(field)[fill(2+rounds-n:size(field, 1)-rounds-1+n, dims)...]
            counter = sum(field[((-1:1) .+ i for i in Tuple(ind))...]) - field[ind]
            newfield[ind] = field[ind] ? counter in (2,3) : counter == 3
        end
        field .= newfield
    end
    sum(field)
end

readInput() = readlines(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"))
part1(data = readInput()) = startup(data, 6, 3)
part2(data = readInput()) = startup(data, 6, 4)
```

Cellular automata puzzles are always fun, and make for some neat visualizations.
Here are a couple of multi dimensional visualizations by [Tom Kwong](https://github.com/tk3369/AdventOfCode2020/):

## [Day 18: Operation Order](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18)

The intended way to solve such problems is by implementing the [Shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm).

However, you can hack the operator precedence in your programming language of choice and take advantage of the built in parser.

Here is [Doug's](https://github.com/dgkf/advent-of-code/blob/98ee142a61b453a766331c65ece372978041935e/2020/18/18.jl) that managed to get him a spot on the global leaderboard.

```julia
readInput() = readlines(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"))

⨦(a,b) = a * b  # define "multiplication" with same precedence as "+"
part1(data = readInput()) = sum(l -> eval(Meta.parse(replace(l, "*" => "⨦"))), data)

⨱(a,b) = a + b  # define "addition" with precedence of "*"
part2(data = readInput()) = sum(l -> eval(Meta.parse(replace(replace(l, "*" => "⨦"), "+" => "⨱"))), data)
```

The key is to find the right operators in your programming language that have the precedence required as per the prompt.

## [Day 19: Monster Messages](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/19)

This was another hard day for me.
First, I tried to implement a recursive algorithm.
After failing to figure this out, I picked it up again on the next day with a clean slate, and I tried to build a regex that would match various messages.
This worked for part 1 but I kept running out of memory for part 2.
Finally, after changing some of the rules hard-coding them by hand I was able to solve part 2.

Specifically, I hard coded rules `"8"` and `"11"` to the following.

```julia
rules["8"] = "(42)+"
rules["11"] = "42 31 | 42 ( 42 31 | 42 ( 42 31 | 42 ( 42 31 | 42 ( 42 31 ) 31 ) 31 ) 31 ) 31"
```

This limits the depth of rule `"11"`. One more step however and I was getting PCRE memory errors.

Here's a solution by [Doug](https://github.com/dgkf/advent-of-code/blob/98ee142a61b453a766331c65ece372978041935e/2020/19/19.jl) that does the same thing elegantly and programmatically.

```julia
function readInput()
  rules, messages = split.(split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), "\n\n"), '\n')
  rules = Dict(map(rules) do line
      m = match(r"^(\d+): (\"(\w+)\"|([^|]+)|(.+))$", line)
      String(m[1]) => m[3] isa Nothing ? (m[4] isa Nothing ? "(?:$(m[5]))" : String(m[4])) : String(m[3])
  end)
  rules, messages
end

function resolve(rule, rules)
    ns = [nsi.match for nsi = eachmatch(r"\b\d+\b", rule)]
    n_res = [Regex("\\b$nsi\\b") for nsi = ns]
    n_rep = [resolve(rules[nsi], rules) for nsi=ns]
    replace(reduce(replace, n_res .=> n_rep, init = rule), " " => "")
end

function part1(data = readInput())
    rules, messages = data
    count(contains(Regex("^$(resolve(rules["0"], rules))\$")), messages)
end

function part2(data = readInput())
    rules, messages = data
    rule42 = resolve(rules["42"], rules)
    rule31 = resolve(rules["31"], rules)
    count(contains(Regex("^$rule42+($rule42(?1)?$rule31)\$")), messages)
end
```

As noted by [/u/furiousleep](https://git.sr.ht/~quf/advent-of-code-2020/) on [/r/adventofcode (along with other valuable feedback)](https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/klmlx2/2020_days_125_idiomatic_solutions_in_julia_with/gh9xhrk/), the intended solution for this would use the [CYK algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm).
I would like to rewrite my solution using this algorithm instead.

## [Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20)

This puzzle was really fun to figure out but also tedious to type out everything that you needed to type out.
While I was able to solve the problem, I hard-coded many things in my solution.
My code doesn't even work for the test cases.
This is just one of those puzzles that is easier to solve on paper than to write an actual working implementation.

Here's a working solution by [Alisdair Sullivan](https://github.com/talentdeficit/aoc2020/blob/1bdc06f7428c8e8c59a2748fbd1c2fa0e04e67c5/bin/twenty/run.jl):

The key functions I found that others were using were `rotl90`, `rotr90` and `rot180` from the Julia standard library, like in [Pablo Zubieta's solution](https://github.com/pabloferz/AoC/blob/5475590e2ac3b08c4800aac59b5ad96e287a8c6a/2020/20/Day20.jl).

[Mark Kittisopikul](https://github.com/mkitti/advent_of_code_2020/blob/27a3886fd71a40a4b745037780cbeacacc770d78/aoc_20/aoc_20.jl) also used `imfilter` from [ImageFiltering.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageFiltering.jl) to find the monsters, which I thought was pretty neat.

## [Day 21: Allergen Assessment](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21)

This puzzle is another graph problem that can be solved quite elegantly using maximum flow algorithms to find the maximum matching.
Here's the solution of the test case using [LightGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl) and [LightGraphFlows.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphsFlows.jl), as well as a visualization using [GraphRecipes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/GraphRecipes.jl) and [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl):

```julia
using LightGraphs
using LightGraphsFlows
using GraphRecipes, Plots

readInput() = strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String))

function m()
    data = split(strip(readInput()), '\n')
    data = map(data) do line
        ingredients, allergens = match(r"^(.*) \(contains (.*)\)$", line).captures
        String.(split(ingredients)), String.(split(allergens, ", "))
    end

    all_ingredients, all_allergens = Set{String}(), Set{String}()
    for (ingredients, allergens) in data
        all_ingredients = all_ingredients ∪ Set(ingredients)
        all_allergens = all_allergens ∪ Set(allergens)
    end
    all_ingredients, all_allergens = collect(all_ingredients), collect(all_allergens)

    d = Dict()
    for (ingredients, allergens) in data, allergen in allergens
        allergen ∉ keys(d) && ( d[allergen] = Set(ingredients) )
        d[allergen] = d[allergen] ∩ Set(ingredients)
    end

    MAX_NODES = length(all_ingredients) + length(all_allergens) + 2
    g = SimpleDiGraph(MAX_NODES)
    for i in all_ingredients
        i = 1 + findfirst(==(i), all_ingredients)
        add_edge!(g, 1, i)
    end
    for a in all_allergens
        a = length(all_ingredients) + 1 + findfirst(==(a), all_allergens)
        add_edge!(g, a, MAX_NODES)
    end
    for (allergen, ingredients) in d, ingredient in ingredients
        i = 1 + findfirst(==(ingredient), all_ingredients)
        a = 1 + length(all_ingredients) + findfirst(==(allergen), all_allergens)
        add_edge!(g, i, a)
    end

    graphplot(g,
        names = 1:MAX_NODES,
        x = vcat([[1]; [2 for _ in 1:length(all_ingredients)]; [3 for _ in 1:length(all_allergens)]; [4]]),
        y = vcat(
                 [
                  [1];
                  [i - length(all_ingredients) ÷ 2 for i in 1:length(all_ingredients)];
                  [a - length(all_allergens) ÷ 2 for a in 1:length(all_allergens)];
                  [1]
                 ]
                ),
        markercolor = vcat([
                            [colorant"white"];
                            [colorant"blue" for _ in 1:length(all_ingredients)];
                            [colorant"green" for _ in 1:length(all_allergens)];
                            [colorant"white"]
                      ]),
        markersize = 1)

    _, F = maximum_flow(g, 1, MAX_NODES)

    no_allergen_ingredients = all_ingredients[[i - 1 for i in 1:MAX_NODES if count(==(0), F[i, :]) == MAX_NODES]]

    no_allergen_ingredients
    sum(map(data) do (ingredients, _)
        count(i ∈ ingredients for i in no_allergen_ingredients)
    end)
end
```

Here are a couple of visualizations, the test data visualized as a graph is on the left and the maximum flow solution on the right.

## [Day 22: Crab Combat](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22)

This puzzle was mostly straightforward too.
The key here seems to be to implement the stopping conditions correctly, and take advantage of the stack based behavior of recursion in most programming languages.

Here's a solution by
[Henrique Ferrolho's](https://github.com/ferrolho/advent-of-code/blob/b34dbe9ee5eef7a36fbf77044c83acc75fbe54cf/2020/22/puzzle.jl).

```julia
function play(p₁, p₂, part₂)
  seen = Set{Tuple{Array,Array}}([])

  while !any(isempty.((p₁, p₂)))
    (p₁, p₂) ∈ seen && return 1, p₁  # infinite-game-prevention rule
    push!(seen, copy.((p₁, p₂)))

    c₁, c₂ = popfirst!.((p₁, p₂))  # both players draw their top card

    if part₂ && all(length.((p₁, p₂)) .>= (c₁, c₂))
      w, _ = play(copy.((p₁[1:c₁], p₂[1:c₂]))..., part₂)
    elseif c₁ > c₂  w = 1
    elseif c₂ > c₁  w = 2
    else @error "Unexpected case: c₁ == c₂" end

    w == 1 && push!(p₁, c₁, c₂)  # player 1 wins
    w == 2 && push!(p₂, c₂, c₁)  # player 2 wins
  end

  !isempty(p₁) ? (1, p₁) : (2, p₂)
end

function day22()
  p₁, p₂ = split(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String), "\n\n") .|>
           x -> parse.(Int, split(x, '\n', keepempty=false)[2:end])

  result₁, result₂ = map([false, true]) do part₂
    _, deck = play(copy.((p₁, p₂))..., part₂)
    multipliers = length(deck):-1:1
    sum(deck .* multipliers)
  end

  result₁, result₂
end

part1() = day22()[1]
part2() = day22()[2]
```

Julia allows using unicode symbols as part of variable names which can make for some pretty looking code.

## [Day 23: Crab Cups](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/23)

This puzzle took me a while to figure out.
I spent way too long looking for patterns in each state.
Thanks to some helpful tips from fellow Julia advent-of-coders, I re-wrote it from scratch using a Linked List.

The key idea is here to manage the ordering in a separate data structure.
Using a linked list is just one way to handle this.

Here's a solution by [Nicolas Viennot](https://github.com/nviennot) based on exchanging ideas with [Teo ShaoWei](https://github.com/Teo-ShaoWei) that manages to do that quite elegantly using another array to manage indices:

```julia
readInput() = parse.(Int32, collect(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String))))

function peek(next, at, n; result=similar(next,n))
    for i in 1:n
        result[i] = next[at]
        at = next[at]
    end
    result
end

function run(cups, steps=1)
    N = length(cups)
    prealloc = similar(cups, 3)

    next = similar(cups)
    for i in 1:N
        next[cups[i]] = cups[mod1(i+1,N)]
    end

    current = cups[1]
    for i in 1:steps
        pickups = peek(next, current, 3, result=prealloc)

        dst = mod1(current-1, N)
        while dst in pickups
          dst = mod1(dst-1, N)
        end

        next[current] = next[pickups[end]]
        next[pickups[end]] = next[dst]
        next[dst] = pickups[1]
        current = next[current]
    end

    return next
end

part1(cups = readInput()) = join(peek(run(cups, 100), 1, 8))
part2(cups = readInput()) = prod(peek(run(vcat(cups, 10:1_000_000), 10_000_000), 1, 2))
```

## [Day 24: Lobby Layout](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24)

In another tribute to John Conway, now you must model hexagon grids.

Having never worked with hexagon grid before, I reached for complex numbers again, which turned out to be a bad idea.
I was indexing a dictionary with the real and imaginary components of the complex number which were floating point numbers.
This caused all sorts of indexing problems due to rounding issues.

I could have sorted this out by using only integer values or by using the coordinate system described in this resource: <https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-cube>.

```render_svgbob
           +----+
          / 0 -1 \
    +----+        +----+
   / -1 0 \  +1  / 1 -1 \
  +        +----+        +
   \   1  / x  z \   0  /
    +----+        +----+
   / -1 1 \   y  / 1  0 \
  +        +----+        +
   \   0  / 0  1 \  -1  /
    '----+        +----+
          \  -1  /
           '----'
```

Here's another elegant solution by [Nicolas Viennot](https://github.com/nviennot).

```julia
using OffsetArrays

parse_path(line) = getproperty.(eachmatch(r"(e|se|sw|w|nw|ne)", line), :match)
readInput() = parse_path.(readlines(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt")))

    "ne" => ( 0,  1)
])

const N = 200

get_destination(path) = mapreduce(x->hex_dirs[x], +, path)

function init_tiles(paths)
    A = OffsetArray(falses(N,N),-N÷2-1,-N÷2-1)
    foreach(dst -> A[dst] ⊻= 1, get_destination.(paths))
    A
end

part1(data = readInput()) = count(init_tiles(data))

function get_neighbor_counts(A)
    C = OffsetArray(zeros(Int, N-2,N-2),-N÷2,-N÷2)

        C[i] = sum(A[i+dir] for dir in values(hex_dirs))
    end
    C
end

function flip_tiles!(A, steps=1)
    for step in 1:steps
        C = get_neighbor_counts(A)
        for i in CartesianIndices(C)
            if (A[i] && C[i] ∉ (1,2)) || (!A[i] && C[i] == 2)
                A[i] ⊻= 1
            end
        end
    end
    A
end

part2(data = readInput()) = count(flip_tiles!(init_tiles(data), 100))

And finally, for the last day, it is a cryptography based puzzle.

The puzzle's key idea here is based on the [Diffie-Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange).

Julia also has a function called `powermod` in the standard library, which can be used for this.
Here's a solution by [Nicolas Viennot](https://github.com/nviennot):

```julia
readInput() = parse.(Int, split(strip(read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "./input.txt"), String)), '\n'))

function part1(data = readInput())
    N = 20201227
    e = 7
    card_public_key, door_public_key = data
    privkey1 = findfirst(i -> powermod(e, i, N) == card_public_key, 1:N)
    solution = powermod(door_public_key, privkey1, N)
end
```

If you've made it all this way, part 2 of day 25 should be a cinch 😉.
