Julia is a high-performance, dynamic programming language designed for technical computing and data science.
The language offers a flexible and expressive syntax, and also delivers the performance benefits of compiled languages like C++.
Like Python, Julia also offers an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment for real-time data exploration and rapid prototyping.

If you are fairly new to Julia, here are a few things you might want to know to improve your developer experience.

## `startup.jl`

Every time you start Julia, it looks for a file named `startup.jl` in a `config` directory.

| Operating System | `startup.jl` Location                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows          | `C:\Users\USERNAME\.julia\config\startup.jl`         |
| macOS            | `/Users/USERNAME/.julia/config/startup.jl`           |
| Linux            | `/home/USERNAME/.julia/config/startup.jl`            |

This file is executed before the REPL starts, allowing you to customize your Julia environment.

For example, if you added the following code to your `startup.jl`, it would ensure that `Revise`, `OhMyREPL` and `BenchmarkTools` are always installed whenever you start Julia.

```julia
# Setup OhMyREPL and Revise
import Pkg
let 
  pkgs = ["Revise", "OhMyREPL", "BenchmarkTools"]
  for pkg in pkgs
    if Base.find_package(pkg) === nothing
      Pkg.add(pkg)
    end
  end
end
```

[This thread on the JuliaLang Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/what-is-in-your-startup-jl/18228) has some neat examples of things you may want to add to your `startup.jl`.

If you wish to go one step further, you can create a Julia package called [Startup.jl](https://github.com/kdheepak/Startup.jl), place it anywhere on your computer and load it in `startup.jl` using the following code:

```julia
if Base.isinteractive()
  push!(LOAD_PATH, joinpath(ENV["HOME"], "gitrepos", "Startup.jl"))
  using Startup
end
```

The advantage of this approach is that the contents of `Startup.jl` can be precompiled and your Julia REPL starts up very quickly.

With the `Startup.jl` package approach, your root environment can be empty and you can still use functionality exposed by `Startup.jl`:

::: callout-tip
You can use `julia --startup-file=no` to _not_ execute the contents for `startup.jl`, i.e. get a clean Julia REPL.

## `OhMyREPL`

[`OhMyREPL.jl`](https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl) is a package that provides syntax highlighting, bracket highlighting, rainbow brackets, and more for the Julia REPL.
Once installed, it can enhance your REPL experience dramatically, making it more visually appealing and easier to work with.

## `Revise.jl`

[`Revise.jl`](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) is a game-changer for Julia development. 
It automatically reloads modified source files without restarting the Julia session. 
This makes iterative development much smoother.

Once set up, any changes you make to your code files are immediately available in your active Julia session.

Revise can "track" changes in single files if you include them using `includet`:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1813121/260318612-abf12aa0-9f48-4082-b6ef-037a81e8fbbb.gif)

If you want `Revise` to track changes in a package you are developing locally, simply run `using Revise` before you load the package for the first time.

See [Revise's documentation](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/config/) for how to set this up to happen automatically all the time by adding setup code to your `startup.jl` file.

::: callout-note
`Revise.jl` cannot deal with changes in `struct`.
In the screenshot below, I change a struct `Foo` like so after tracking the file with `Revise`:

```diff
  struct Foo
-   x::Int
+   y::Float64
  end
```

`Revise` throws a warning and changes the color of the Julia prompt:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1813121/260318027-906d7506-0c98-417f-9ef3-008d39097117.gif)

There are some workarounds for this but the easiest thing to do is to **restart the Julia session** if you are making changes to a `struct`.
Watch for the `Revise` warnings and errors and keep an eye out for the color of your Julia REPL prompt. If you see it in "yellow", you know `Revise` wasn't able to track a change you made.
:::

## `Infiltrator`

[`Infiltrator.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Infiltrator.jl) is a debugger and code inspection tool for Julia.
It allows you to insert breakpoints in your code and inspect the current scope's variables.

When Julia hits the `@infiltrate` macro, it'll pause execution, and drop you into a Julia REPL that allows you to inspect the current scope.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1813121/260319341-8f1d5ca9-f192-4277-abc3-be4f89dd8610.gif)

You can also use `@infiltrate i == 3` and that'll drop you into a Julia REPL only in the third iteration of the `for` loop.

When using `@infiltrate conditional_expression` with `Revise`, you can jump into any function at any point of the execution to inspect values of variables in a Julia REPL.
You can even load additional packages like `DataFrames` or `Plots` to explore your data in the scope of any function interactively while debugging.
This combination can make for a versatile and productive debugging experience.

## `PrecompileTools`

[PrecompileTools](https://julialang.github.io/PrecompileTools.jl/stable/) is a package that allows package developers to specify which parts of the package should be precompiled.
From the official documentation:

> `PrecompileTools` can force precompilation of specific workloads; particularly with Julia 1.9 and higher, the precompiled code can be saved to disk, so that it doesn't need to be compiled freshly in each Julia session. 
> You can use `PrecompileTools` as a package developer, to reduce the latency experienced by users of your package for "typical" workloads; you can also use `PrecompileTools` as a user, creating custom "Startup" package(s) that precompile workloads important for your work.

Precompiling Julia packages can significantly reduce the loading times for you and your users, providing a much more responsive experience.

For example, I have the following in my `Startup.jl` to improve Julia REPL startup times:

```julia
module Startup

using PrecompileTools

@setup_workload begin
  @compile_workload begin
    using Pkg
    using Revise
    using OhMyREPL
  end
end

end
```

## `BenchmarkTools`

[BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl) is an essential package to help quantify the performance of your code.
It provides utilities to benchmark code snippets, giving insights into their run-time and memory allocations.

For example, the `@benchmark` macro runs a number of trials of a function and plots a histogram in the terminal showing what kind of performance you are getting out of that particular function.
As an example, we can compare the performance of a custom `sum` function without and with the `@simd` macro:

## `Cthulhu`

Delving deep into Julia's compiler optimizations and type inference can sometimes feel daunting. 

[`Cthulhu.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Cthulhu.jl) is an alternative interactive terminal user interface to `@code_lowered` and `@code_typed` that allows developers to dive into the lowered and optimized versions of their Julia code, making it easier to debug performance issues and understand how Julia's JIT compiler optimizes code.

Using Cthulhu, you can:

- View the lowered representation of functions
- Understand type-inference issues
- Step through optimized LLVM code interactively

For example, if we examine the `mysum` function from the previous section, we can see that `a` is being inferred as a `Int64` or a `Float64`, i.e. `Union{Float64, Int64}`.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1813121/260274805-ea3dcdbd-a750-4b4a-8869-ea7ee9d92e8b.png)

In this particular case, by changing `a = 0` to `a = 0.0`, we can make the code generated by Julia more optimized.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1813121/260308464-07577d0f-e577-40a7-bb96-3a109f53a815.png)

Here's the benchmark results with `a = 0` (left) and `a = 0.0` (right):

## `ReTest` and `InlineTests`

Julia has a built-in package `Test` for unit testing.
This requires writing tests in `test/runtests.jl` and are run in a separate process.

Using `InlineTests` together with `Revise` allows you to write tests directly in your source files, and you can make changes that are tracked with `Revise`, allowing faster iteration with test driven development.

In the screenshot below, I have shown an example of having a `@testset` as part of the package itself, i.e. in `./src/layout.jl`:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1813121/260308140-a1b24006-3495-4d3a-8534-c6bb24a621c8.png)

This allows co-locating tests along with the implementation.

You'll also notice from the screenshot that `ReTest` contains a function called `retest` which allows running a subset of tests by passing in a pattern as the second argument.

## `LiveServer`

[`LiveServer.jl`](https://github.com/tlienart/LiveServer.jl) allows developers to serve static sites locally and refreshes your browser automatically as you edit source files.
You can even use it as to view or update documentation.

```julia
# serve contents of any folder
LiveServer.serve(; dir, launch_browser = true)

# serve documentation of any package
Pkg.activate("./docs")
LiveServer.servedocs(; launch_browser = true)
```

## `Comonicon`

[Comonicon.jl](https://github.com/comonicon/Comonicon.jl) is a rich tool for building command-line applications.
Comonicon allows you to easily convert your Julia scripts and packages into command-line tools with minimal effort.

Using Comonicon, you can:

- Parse command-line arguments
- Generate help messages
- Handle subcommands
- And more

For example, I've added into my [`Startup.jl/src/jl.jl`](https://github.com/kdheepak/Startup.jl/blob/d1959b2d08868b04d3f33911b6260275bb22a34b/src/jl.jl) some helper subcommands that I can access from that command line in any folder.

## Conclusion

Julia's ecosystem is filled with tools designed to optimize the developer's workflow, making it easier and more efficient to write, test, and deploy code.
