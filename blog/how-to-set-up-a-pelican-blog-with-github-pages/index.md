summary: Here, I will show how to set up a working static blog on github pages using Pelican. Pelican is a static site generator, written in Python ...

I've been quite vocal about the benefits of blogging using Markdown, and using a static page generator with Pandoc instead of the conventional CMS.
But a lot of people I've spoken to have expressed their doubts about the simplicity of the process.
I figured if I could fit it in one blog post I could claim it were simple, right?

# Markdown

Advantages

- Easy to learn - It has almost no syntax. You can learn how to format like a pro in half an hour.
- Fast - You don't have to deal with HTML tags or WYSIWYG editors.
- Platform independent - You can edit your blog posts from anywhere, be it on your PC, tablet or mobile device.
  You can even use your favourite text editor. (which is obviously VIM, right?)
- Markdown handles all of the following beautifully:
  - lists
  - links
  - headers
  - blockquotes
  - bold and emphasized text
  - blockquotes
  - code blocks

This is what this post looks like in Markdown.

It really is that simple.

# Static pages

Advantages

- Fast - It loads extremely quickly.
- Portable - You can easily move from a server space and deploy it elsewhere.
- Cheaper - It is cost effective for a small website / personal blogs.

Disadvantages

- Typically required web development experience to make changes to website.
- Complicated and a lot of work when you have a lot of pages e.g. a personal blog.

# Enter Github pages and Pelican

Github pages takes away from all the disadvantages of static pages, and adds a few pros as well.
Version control was a big plus for me.
And static site generators like Jekyll and Pelican make it extremely easy to create web content without any actual web development.
I choose Pelican because it was Python based, and it seemed to have a good selection of themes.

# Install required packages

```bash
pip install pelican
pip install markdown
pip install ghp-import
```

ghp-import is a cli that allows you to easily push your changes to your github repository

These are optional packages to install that may come in handy later

```bash
pip install Pillow beautifulsoup4 cssmin cssprefixer cssutils pretty six smartypants typogrify webassets
```

# Create a Github account and a User or Project page

[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) has instructions on how to create a User or Project page, and will in fact walk you through the process.
If you create a User page, your website will be live at `$GHUSERNAME`.github.io and a Project page will go up at `$GHUSERNAME`.github.io/`$PROJECTNAME`.
The rest of this blog assumes you want to create a User page.

# Create a directory for your website

Assuming `$GHUSERNAME` is your github username, run the following commands. You can rename the 'website' folder to anything you want.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/$GHUSERNAME/$GHUSERNAME.github.io/ website
cd website
```

# Run Pelican quickstart

```bash
pelican-quickstart
```

This is what you might get. Answer all the questions
