::: callout-note
Quarto supports native MermaidJS integration, so I've decided to use that instead. You can use the filter from here: <https://github.com/kdheepak/blog/blob/61d1186313f3eb73ac51968a4bd5d051d822da37/pandoc/render.lua>.

GitHub recently announced [support for MermaidJS](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/).
I thought it would be nice to integrate it as part of my blog using Pandoc lua filters.
So the following:

````
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```
````

would be rendered as:

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```
