If you've used `lazygit` or `tig`, you've probably seen graphs used to represent commit history in
the terminal. Here's an example from `tig`:

```plaintext
●─╮ build(deps): bump actions/checkout from 2 to 4 (#569)
●─│─╮ build(deps): bump peaceiris/actions-gh-pages from 3 to 4 (#568)
●─│─│─╮ build(deps): bump softprops/action-gh-release from 1 to 2 (#567)
●─│─│─│─╮ build(deps): bump actions/setup-python from 1 to 5 (#566)
●─│─│─│─│─╮ build(deps): bump nwtgck/actions-netlify from 2.0 to 3.0 (#565)

In this post, I'll explore a few different styles of graphs that can be used in terminal
applications.

I'm going to use the convention used by graphviz to represent graphs in text form. For example, the
following text represents a directed graph:

```{dot}
//| label: fig-simple
//| fig-cap: "This is a simple directed graph."
//| echo: true
digraph G {
  A -> B;
  B -> { C D };
  C -> E;
  D -> E;
  E;
}

```




## Ascii Style vs Unicode Style

The most basic style is the ascii style, which uses characters like `|`, `-`, `+`, and `*` to
represent the graph. This style is simple and widely supported, however, for most fonts, it can look
blocky and less visually appealing.
