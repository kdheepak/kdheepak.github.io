This page is a test of using a svelte component when using pandoc as a preprocessor.

The following is a button that is a Svelte component that increments a counter when you click on it:

<script>
    import Counter from "$lib/components/Counter.svelte"
</script>

<Counter/>

The following is the code I included in the Markdown source file:

```svelte
<script>
  import Counter from "$lib/components/Counter.svelte";
</script>

<Counter />
```

You can click on the date in this blog post to see the source markdown file that was used to render this page.
