Getting patched fonts for a powerline in the terminal can be quite an adventure, especially when you are using vim and tmux.
I almost gave up on it, but now that I've figured it out it seems extremely obvious.

```bash
# pip install --user powerline-status
# brew install fontforge --with-python
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
cd fonts
./install.sh
```

Most importantly, select the font with the word `powerline` in the name in the preferences option of your terminal.
