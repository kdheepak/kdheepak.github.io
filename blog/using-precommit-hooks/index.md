# Setting up `pre-commit` for a git repo

You can run scripts before creating a commit in a git repo, i.e. `pre-commit` hooks, to verify that the files you are checking in meet a predefined standard.
[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) is a Python package that let's you manage and run `pre-commit` hooks in any git repository.

Using `pre-commit` requires adding a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to the git repository, and running `pre-commit install`.

1. Add a file called `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the root of your git repository, and add the hooks you want in that file. This is an example of a [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](https://github.com/kdheepak/dotfiles/blob/48567f59c346c00318a670269e3e52172d469f75/.pre-commit-config.yaml) file:
   ```yaml
   # cat /path/to/gitrepos/reponame/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml
   repos:
   - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
     rev: v3.1.0
     hooks:
         - id: trailing-whitespace
         - id: check-executables-have-shebangs
         - id: check-json
         - id: check-case-conflict
         - id: check-toml
         - id: check-merge-conflict
         - id: check-xml
         - id: check-yaml
         - id: end-of-file-fixer
         - id: check-symlinks
         - id: fix-encoding-pragma
         - id: mixed-line-ending
         - id: pretty-format-json
           args: [--autofix]
    - repo: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8
      rev: 3.8.3
      hooks:
          - id: flake8
            args: [
                '--max-line-length=150',
                '--ignore=E203,E402,E501,E800,W503,W391,E261',
                '--select=B,C,E,F,W,T4,B9'
                ]
   - repo: https://github.com/ambv/black
     rev: 19.10b0
     hooks:
         - id: black
           args: [--line-length=150, --safe]
   ```
2. Install `pre-commit` and run `pre-commit install`.
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

# Using `setup.py` to install `pre-commit` hooks

You can have `setup.py` automatically run `precommit install` when setting up a developer environment.

To do this, add a `PostDevelopCommand` hook to `setup.py`. Here's a minimal example:

```python
import os
import logging
from codecs import open
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
from setuptools.command.develop import develop
from subprocess import check_call
import shlex

# Create post develop command class for hooking into the python setup process
# This command will run after dependencies are installed
class PostDevelopCommand(develop):
    def run(self):
        try:
            check_call(shlex.split("pre-commit install"))
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning("Unable to run 'pre-commit install'")
        develop.run(self)

install_requires = ["networkx"] # alternatively, read from `requirements.txt`
extra_requires = ["pandas"]     # optional dependencies
test_requires = ["pytest"]      # test dependencies
dev_requires = ["pre-commit"]   # dev dependencies

setup(
    name="packagename",
    version="v0.1.0",
    install_requires=install_requires,
    extras_require={
        "test": test_requires,
        "extra": extra_requires,
        "dev": test_requires + extra_requires + dev_requires,
    },
    cmdclass={"develop": PostDevelopCommand},
)
```

Then, during the first time you want to start working on the project you can run the following to setup your development environment:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This will install `install_requires`, `test_requires`, `extra_requires` and `dev_requires` dependencies.
This will also run `pre-commit install` in the git repository, which will add the hooks from the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

If you don't want to automatically run `pre-commit install`, remove the `cmdclass={"develop": PostDevelopCommand}` line in the `setup(...)` function arguments.

# Using `pre-commit-hooks` for all git repos

If you want to use `pre-commit-hooks` for all git repositories on your machine, you can set up a `git-templates` folder that is used as a `templatedir` when you run `git init`.

Add the following to your [`~/.gitconfig`](https://github.com/kdheepak/dotfiles/blob/48567f59c346c00318a670269e3e52172d469f75/gitconfig#L176-L177) file [^gitconfig].

[^gitconfig]:
    On Windows, the file is located at `C:\Users\USERNAME\.gitconfig`.
    Also, `git` will not create this file unless you ask for it.
    You can create it by running `git config --global --edit`.

```toml
[init]
  templatedir = ~/gitrepos/git-templates
```

Now create a `~/gitrepos/dotfiles/git-templates` folder with a single folder inside it called `hooks`, and with a single executable file inside the `hooks` folder called `pre-commit`.

```bash
tree git-templates
```

```
git-templates
└── hooks
   ├── commit-msg
   └── pre-commit
```

You can create a text file and make it executable by running `chmod +x pre-commit`.
In that file, you can make `pre-commit` point to a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file of your choosing.

This will make `git init` use the `templatedir` as a template when you create a new git repository.

Here is what my [`git-templates/hooks/pre-commit`](https://github.com/kdheepak/dotfiles/blob/48567f59c346c00318a670269e3e52172d469f75/git-templates/hooks/pre-commit) file looks like:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
pre-commit run --config ~/gitrepos/dotfiles/.pre-commit-config.yaml
```

You can place the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` wherever you like.
I have mine in my [`~/gitrepos/dotfiles`](https://github.com/kdheepak/dotfiles/) repository.
If you have set it up correctly, the next time you run `git init` the pre-commit hooks will be set up in your git repository based on the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file you set up.

# `git commit --no-verify`

Finally, if you want to bypass the `pre-commit` hooks in special circumstances, you can add the `--no-verify` flag to your `git commit` command.

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

This will run `git commit` without any `pre-commit` hooks.

# Troubleshooting

You can update the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file if something goes wrong, to suit your configuration.
For example, you may have to configure it to point to a specific version of Python on your machine if it doesn't point to the correct version by default.

You also can change the `flake8` errors and warnings that you'd like to ignore by changing the arguments to `flake8`.
You can read about all the different `flake8` errors and warning over here: <https://www.flake8rules.com/>.
