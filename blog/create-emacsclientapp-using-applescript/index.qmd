Open Automator and go to File->New. Click on Application.

Then search for 'Run AppleScript' and drag it to the window on the right.

Copy paste the following gist to the window

```default
on run {input}
	try
		set emacs_client_path to "usr/local/bin/"
		set pathtofile to quoted form of POSIX path of input

		set frameVisible to do shell script emacs_client_path & "emacsclient -e '(<= 2 (length (visible-frame-list)))'"
		if frameVisible is "t" then
			do shell script emacs_client_path & "emacsclient -n " & pathtofile
		else
			-- there is a not a visible frame, launch one
			do shell script emacs_client_path & "emacsclient -c -n " & pathtofile
		end if

	on error
		set emacs_client_path to "usr/local/bin/"
		do shell script emacs_client_path & "emacsclient -c -n "
	end try

	-- bring the visible frame to the front
	tell application "Emacs" to activate

end run
```

Save the application in `/Applications` or `/Users/$USER/Applications`. Now you can
quickly open emacsclient from Alfred.
