Both eggs are identical. The aim is to find out the highest floor from which an egg will not break when dropped out of a window from that floor. If an egg is dropped and does not break, it is undamaged and can be dropped again. However, once an egg is broken, thatâ€™s it for that egg.\n>\n> If an egg breaks when dropped from a floor, then it would also have broken from any floor above that. If an egg survives a fall, then it will survive any fall shorter than that.\n>\n> The question is: What strategy should you adopt to minimize the number egg drops it takes to find the solution? (And what is the worst case for the number of drops it will take?)\n>\n> Once you solved it for two eggs, can you solve it for three eggs? Can you find a generalized solution when you have a tower with $x$ floors and if you have $N$ eggs?\n\n**_Spoiler warning_**: If you have not seen this problem before I urge you to give it a go before continuing further. I'm going to post the solution to this below, so this is your spoiler warning.\n\nIf you are interested in an easy to understand intuitive explanation to the $2$ egg $100$ storey tower problem, check out the following video:\n\n<figure class=\"iframe-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NGtt7GJ1uiM?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nWe will go through this problem for the $2$ eggs and $3$ eggs variant, and derive the solution mathematically.\nThen, we will generalize the problem with $x$ floors and $N$ eggs.\n\n# Two eggs\n\nWe have $2$ eggs to start with and a $100$ storey tower to explore.\n\nLet's consider what we would do if we had just one egg.\n\nWith just one egg, we could drop the egg from floor $1$.\nIf it breaks, we stop and can definitively say that for any floor $1$ and above all eggs would break.\nIf it doesn't break, we can proceed to floor $2$ and repeat.\n\nThis means that for a tower with $100$ floors we will need up to $100$ drops to definitively say at which floor the egg would break.\nThe above strategy gives us the _minimum_ number of drops to _guarantee_ that we find at which floor the egg would break.\nOr in other words, we can search $N$ floors with $N$ drops.\nLet's call the lowest floor in the tower at which a egg would break the _breaking floor_.\nHere, $N$ is the breaking floor and $N-1$ is the highest floor from which an egg will not break.\nOnce we can find the breaking floor, we can find the solution to this puzzle.\nThe aim of this puzzle is to minimize the worst case when trying to guarantee finding the breaking floor.\n\nWhat could we do differently with $2$ eggs?\n\nWith $2$ eggs, in fact we can explore the search space more efficiently.\nWe can use the first egg to partition the total number of floors, and once the first egg breaks we can use the second egg to search floors within the last partition.\n\nAs an example, let's say you decide to drop the first egg from every $10^{th}$ floor.\nIf it doesn't break at floor $10$, $20$, $30$, $40$ or $50$ but breaks at floor $60$ you can use the second egg to explore floors $51$ - $59$.\nIf it finally breaks at floor $59$, you would have used $6$ drops of the first egg and $9$ drops of the second egg to find the breaking floor.\n\nWe can do even better though.\n\nLet's assume that the minimum number of drops required to guarantee finding the breaking floor for a $N$ storey tower is $x$.\nIf when we drop the first egg and the egg breaks, we can use $x - 1$ drops of the second egg to find the breaking floor.\nWe already know that we can search at most $x - 1$ floors with the $1$ egg using $x - 1$ drops.\nSo if our first drop was from a floor greater than $x$, we would not be able to guarantee finding the solution to this problem.\nThis means that if we have $2$ eggs we would want to drop the first egg from floor $x$, where $x$ is also the minimum number of drops that will guarantee finding the breaking floor in a $N$ storey tower.\n\nWhen we drop the first egg from floor $x$, if the egg breaks, we can use the second egg to find which floor from $1$ to $x - 1$ is the solution.\nIf the egg doesn't break, now we have used $1$ drop.\nLet's assume that the first egg breaks on the second drop.\nWhen this happens, we can use the remaining egg to explore $x - 2$ floors with $x - 2$ drops find the breaking floor.\nWith $x - 2$ drops, we can search from floor $x + 1$ to floor $x + (x - 2)$.\nThis means that when we drop the first egg the second time, we should start from $x + (x - 2) + 1$, i.e., $x + (x - 1)$, to allow for finding the breaking floor.\n\nIf the egg doesn't break on the second drop, we have now used $2$ drops.\nIf the egg is going to break on the third drop, we have to allow for searching $x - 3$ floors with the second egg.\nThis means we should drop the first egg on our third attempt from floor number $x + (x - 1) + (x - 3) + 1$, i.e., $x + (x - 1) + (x - 2)$.\nWe can also say that with $3$ drops and $2$ eggs we are guaranteed to find the floor if it is within the first $3 + (3 - 1) + (3 - 2)$ floors, i.e. $6$ floors.\n\nSeeing the pattern here?\n\nFor a $N$ storey tower, we need to ensure that with $x$ drops we cover all the floors of the tower.\nThat gives us this constraint.\n\n$$x + (x - 1) + (x - 2) + (x - 3) + \\ldots + 1 >= N$$\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{x} k >= N$$\n\nOr, in closed form as:\n\n$$\\frac{x \\times (1 + x)}{2} >= N$$\n\nWe know $N$ is $100$ in this problem.\n\n$$\\frac{x \\times (1 + x)}{2} >= 100$$\n\nThis tells us that with $14$ drops we can guarantee finding the breaking floor in a tower with up to $105$ floors.\n\n# Three eggs\n\nWe have already previously established the best strategy for $1$ egg and $2$ eggs.\n\nLet's define some terminology:\n\n$$f_1(x) = x$$\n$$f_2(x) = \\frac{x \\times (1 + x)}{2}$$\n\nwhere $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$ are the number of floors that can be checked with $1$ and $2$ eggs respectively with $x$ drops.\n\nAnd we know that $f_2(x)$ can be written as:\n\n$$f_2(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{x} k$$\n\nSo if we have 3 eggs and if the first egg breaks on the first drop, we want to ensure that we can check $f_2(x - 1)$ floors with the remaining $x - 1$ drops.\nThat means we should drop the first egg from floor:\n\n$$1 + f_2(x - 1)$$\n\nFor the second drop, we can start from floor:\n\n$$1 + f_2(x - 1) + 1 + f_2(x - 2)$$\n\nFor the third drop, we can start from floor:\n\n$$1 + f_2(x - 1) + 1 + f_2(x - 2) + 1 + f_2(x - 3)$$\n\nSeeing a pattern emerge again?\n\nSimilar to before, the total number of floors we can check is constrained by $N$:\n\n$$1 + f_2(x - 1) + 1 + f_2(x - 2) + 1 + f_2(x - 3) + \\ldots + 1 >= N$$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{x-1} \\left( 1 + f_2(k) \\right) + 1 >= N$$\n\n$$1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{x-1} \\left( 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{j} k \\right) >= N$$\n\n$$x + \\sum_{j=1}^{x-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{j} k >= N$$\n\nwhich results in:\n\n$$\\frac{x^3 + 5x}{6} >= N$$\n\nSolving this, we get $9$ drops for $3$ eggs. With just $9$ drops, we can guarantee finding the breaking floor in a $129$ storey tower.\n\n# $N$ eggs\n\nLet's see if we can generalize this for $N$ eggs.\n\nWith $1$ egg and $x$ drops, we know we can check $x$ floors. Let's define this as $f(x, 1)$, i.e.:\n\n$$f(x, 1) = x$$ {#eq-f_x_1}\n\nwhere $f(x, n)$ is the floors that can be checked with $x$ drops and $n$ eggs.\n\nWe can safely say that with $0$ drops or $0$ eggs we can check $0$ floors.\n\n$$f(0, n) = f(x, 0) = 0$$\n\nSo we can write @eq-f_x_1 as the following:\n\n$$f(x, 1) = 1 + f(x-1, 1) + f(x-1, 0)$$\n\nFor $2$ eggs and $x$ drops, the number of floors we can check, i.e. $f(x, 2)$, is:\n\n$$f(x, 2) = \\sum_{k=1}^{x} k$$ {#eq-f_x_2}\n\nWe can expand this as the following:\n\n$$f(x, 2) = 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{x-1} k + x - 1$$\n\nand substitute in @eq-f_x_1 to get:\n\n$$f(x, 2) = 1 + f(x-1, 2) + f(x-1, 1)$$\n\nAnd, for $3$ eggs and $x$ drops, the number of floors we can check, i.e. $f(x, 2)$, is:\n\n$$f(x, 3) = x + \\sum_{j=1}^{x-1}\\sum_{k=1}^{j} k$$\n\nAgain, we can expand it and rearrange some terms:\n\n$$f(x, 3) = x + \\sum_{j=1}^{x-2}\\sum_{k=1}^{j} k + \\sum_{k=1}^{x-1} k$$\n\n$$f(x, 3) = 1 + x - 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{x-2}\\sum_{k=1}^{j} k + \\sum_{k=1}^{x-1} k$$\n\nand substitute in @eq-f_x_2 to get:\n\n$$f(x, 3) = 1 + f(x - 1, 3) + f(x - 1, 2)$$\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging here. The generalized equation can be written like so:\n\n$$f(x, n) = 1 + f(x - 1, n) + f(x - 1, n - 1)$$ {#eq-f_x_n}\n\nThis is also known as a recurrence relation.\n\nThis result can be reasoned through intuition as well.\nTo find the total floors you can check with $n$ eggs and $x$ drops, it will be $1$ (your first drop) plus the maximum number of floors you can check with $n$ eggs and $x-1$ eggs (if the first egg does not break) plus the maximum number of floors you can check with $n-1$ eggs with $x-1$ eggs (if the first egg does break).\n\nIf we wanted to, we could expand this recurrence relation[^possiblywrong].\n\n[^possiblywrong]: Thanks to [/u/possiblywrong](https://old.reddit.com/r/mathriddles/comments/gxnihd/the_two_egg_tower_puzzle/ft5qkkh/) for pointing this out [@possiblywrong].\n\nHere is the expansion increasing the depth in the direction of number of drops:\n\n$$f(x, n) = 1 + f(x - 1, n) + f(x - 1, n - 1)$$\n\n$$f(x, n) = 3 + f(x - 2, n) + 2f(x - 2, n - 1) + f(x - 2, n - 2)$$\n\n$$f(x, n) = 7 + f(x - 3, n) + 3f(x - 3, n - 1) + 3f(x - 3, n - 2) + f(x - 3, n - 3)$$\n\n$$f(x, n) = 15 + f(x - 4, n) + 4f(x - 4, n - 1) + 6f(x - 4, n - 2) + 4f(x - 4, n - 3) + f(x - 4, n - 4)$$\n\n$$f(x, n) = 31 + f(x - 5, n) + 5f(x - 5, n - 1) + 10f(x - 5, n - 2) + 10f(x - 5, n - 3) + 5f(x - 5, n - 4) + f(x - 5, n - 5)$$\n\n$$f(x, n) = 63 + f(x - 6, n) + 6f(x - 6, n - 1) + 15f(x - 6, n - 2) + 20f(x - 6, n - 3) + 15f(x - 6, n - 4) + 6f(x - 6, n - 5) + f(x - 6, n - 6)$$\n\nEagle eye readers will notice a pattern.\n\n![Binomial coefficients in Pascal's triangle](pascaltriangle.svg)\n\nIt turns out that this expansion is related to the [binomial coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient).\n\nIf we had infinite number of eggs, you'd see that the first element is the only term that contributes to $f(x, n)$, since the others will be $0$ for $x - d$ where $d$ is the depth in the triangle.\nThat is to say, if we had infinite eggs, with 6 drops we can guarantee checking 63 floors.\n\nUsing this, we can say that, with $x$ drops we can guarantee checking $2^x - 1$ floors if we had infinite eggs[^mark_ovchain].\n\n[^mark_ovchain]: If we had a finite number of eggs, an approximation of this recurrence can be made. See [/u/mark_ovchain's insightful comment on this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/mathriddles/comments/gxnihd/the_two_egg_tower_puzzle/ft6gi6k/?context=1) for more information.\n\n# Implementation\n\nLet's implement this problem.\n\n```julia\njulia> println(VERSION)\n1.4.0\n```\n\nWe can implement @eq-f_x_n as a function:\n\n```julia\njulia> f(x, n) = x == 0 || n == 0 ? 0 : 1 + f(x - 1, n) + f(x - 1, n - 1)\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n\nFor $1$ egg, the number of floors you can check is the number of drops you make.\n\n```julia\njulia> arr = 1:100;\n\njulia> @test f.(arr, 1) == arr\nTest Passed\n```\n\nAnd, we can verify that it works for $2$ eggs as well.\n\n```julia\njulia> @test f(14, 2) >= 100\nTest Passed\n\njulia> @test f(14, 2) == 105\nTest Passed\n```\n\nWe can implement this generally like so:\n\n```julia\njulia> function starting_floor(floors, n)\n         for x in 1:floors\n             if f(x, n) >= floors\n                 return x\n             end\n         end\n       end\nstarting_floor (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n\nAnd get the answer to the problem programmatically.\n\n```julia\njulia> starting_floor(100, 2)\n14\n```\n\nUsing the function `f`, we can also generate a table that explores what is the maximum number of floors that can be check for various number of drops and eggs.\n\n<!--
