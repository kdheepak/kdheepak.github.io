When I work with markdown, $\LaTeX$ or code that requires compiling, I like to
check often if everything looks okay. Emacs has a good description of everything
you can do with the [CompileCommand](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/CompileCommand).

However, it does not have a description for auto-closing the buffer if the
compilation was successful. [StackOverflow](http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/336) to the rescue!

    #!lisp
    ; from enberg on #emacs
    (setq compilation-finish-function
    (lambda (buf str)
        (if (null (string-match ".*exited abnormally.*" str))
            ;;no errors, make the compilation window go away in a few seconds
            (progn
                (run-at-time
                "1 sec" nil 'delete-windows-on
                (get-buffer-create "*compilation*"))
            (message "No Compilation Errors!")))))

Insert the above code into your .emacs file. You can change the time you wish
the buffer to be available by changing the "1 sec" in the above code
